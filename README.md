#EX2 - TodoListManager
This branch includes the ex2 in the POST PC course. 
The ex is a simple todo list manager - adds and deletes todo msgs.

V2:
A dialog for inserting new items into the list.
Once a user taps on the add button FAB the dialog will open and show the a date picker for when to remind and a text input field for what should be reminded.
There is a positive and a negative button to this dialog to allow users to confirm or cancel their reminder

A popup for when an item is clicked.
when the user clicks the item on the TODO list, it should open a popup with the reminder inserted with actions to be done

If the reminder is for calling (should start with the word "call" followed by a number , the app should start the dialer with the number to call


Have Fun :)
